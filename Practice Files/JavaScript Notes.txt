JavaScript Notes
- high level, interpreted programming language
- runs on the client/browser as well as on the server (Node.js)
- conforms to the ECMAScript specifications
- multi-paradigm, multiple ways to do something
- programming language of the browser
- Build very interactable user interfaces with frameworks like React

- semi colons arent mandatory, but should prob use them
- single or double quotes work

<script></script>
- put it at the bottom of an HTML file.
- HOWEVER its recommended to put it in its own .js file

Variables
- var, let, and const
- 'var' is not used anymore because it is globally scoped. It can cause issues when being reused
- 'let' can be reassigned, 'const' cannot
- use 'const' only if you know you are not going to reassign it

Data Types
- Strings, Numbers, Boolean, null, undefined, and Symbol
Strings
- Concatenation
    console.log('My name is ' + name + 'and I am ' + age);
- is OLD way to do it^
- Now we can do it easier, nicer like this...
    console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age}`);
Arrays
- you can have multiple data types in an Array
- 'unshift' to add to beginning
- 'push' to add to the end of the array
- 'pop' gets rid of the last one
- if you want to see if something is an array use
    console.log(Array.isArray(fruits));
    'fruits' is name of object in this case

todoJSON
- LEARN ABOUT JSON
- we can convert into JSON within our script. (code in main.js)

conditionals
- == checks for the value
- === checks for value and data type. so 'string 10' cannot be 'int 10'
